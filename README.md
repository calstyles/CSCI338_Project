# CSCI338_Project
## Object Recognition

This project takes images found in the UNCA CSCI textbook collection and allows a user to search for images based on user input such as, but not limited to, 
"Find images on... Bar graph, Line graph, Linked list etc"


Libraries to support machine learing will be considered soon.

GUI is PyQt5/6.
